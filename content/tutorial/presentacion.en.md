# Introduction

Tutorial is a space that I am making while I am learning to use "Hugo", and in this part learning to write English. For learning "Hugo" I am using the syllabus of the subject that the teacher gave to us, and the Mike Danes's youtube channel. To learn English I am using Word Reference and the patience of my son (Son note: Send help.).
