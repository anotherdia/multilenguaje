## Publish in some languages.

With Hugo you can have your page in several languages. Each language site is diferent and you must make them one by one. You need to define the languages that you have inside your page and the documents that are inside. 
The first step is to change the file *config.toml* that is inside of the folder in which you are working. No into the theme. With this you have a menu to select the language.

## How does it work.

The language menu is very easy to use and intuitive, here I am talking about the "learn" theme. A menu appears, which has the different languages.

## Ways do it.

One way is making the translation by filename, another option is the translation of Strings.

### Translation by filename.

In this case we have two files.

    1.- tutorial/idiomas.en.md
    2.- tutorial/idiomas.es.md

The first is assigned the English language, the second is assigned the Spanish language. Both are linked to each other.
